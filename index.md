##### What are crypto faucets?

Crypto faucets are sites or apps that dispense bitcoin or other altcoins for free. Now, before you get too excited, you won't be able to make a living out of this. But, it is a good way to earn some extra cash on the side. It is also a good way to learn about cryptocurrencies as an emerging technology and how they work without investing a cent.

Below is a list I have compiled of the faucet sites I use and have paid out. I'll keep the list updated and add to it or remove sites that stop paying out.

Coins you earn can be withdrawn as Bitcoin (BTC) or Dogecoin (DOGE). Withdrawals made can be sent to your personal bitcoin/dogecoin address or your [FaucetHub](http://faucethub.io/r/42665771) account. 

[FaucetHub](http://faucethub.io/r/42665771) is a microwallet for cryptocurrencies and allows you to instantly receive payments from hundreds of faucets. I recommend using it as thresholds for withdrawal are much lower with [FaucetHub](http://faucethub.io/r/42665771).

Operating since 2014, [FreeBitco.in](https://freebitco.in/?r=13252621) has proven itself to be very reliable and on time with their payments. There are 4 ways in which you can earn bitcoin here.

- Free BTC Rolls

Every hour you get a free roll for a chance to win up to US$200 (BTC amount will vary depending on its market price). 

- Multiply Bitcoin

A provablty fair Hi-Lo game in which you can multiply your earnings. I would recommend playing this just for fun as it is quite risky. Just know when to quit and don't wager too much.

- Interest

[FreeBitco.in](https://freebitco.in/?r=13252621) is unique in that it also acts as a Bitcoin Bank where you receive compounding *daily* interest by just leaving your coins in your account. Minimum amount of bitcoin needed to start accruing is 30,000 satoshi (0.0003 BTC). Annual interest rate is around 4%.

- Lottery and Reward Points

For every Free BTC roll you make you receive 2 lottery tickets and 2 reward points. The tickets enters you into a lottery draw where up to 10 people win each week. 

The rewards points can be redeemed for prizes ranging from mobile phones to hardware wallets and gift cards. The reward points can also be used to boost your free BTC rolls up to 1000%.
