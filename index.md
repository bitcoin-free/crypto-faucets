### What are crypto faucets?

Crypto faucets are sites or apps that dispense bitcoin or other altcoins for free. Now, before you get too excited, you won't be able to make a living out of this. But, it is a good way to earn some extra cash on the side. It is also a good way to learn about cryptocurrencies as an emerging technology and how they work without investing a cent.

Below I have compiled a list of the faucet sites I use that have paid out. I'll keep the list updated to add to it or remove sites that stop paying out.

### Direct-to-wallet Faucets
Faucets that send your earnings directly to your crypto wallet.

<b>[Cointiply](https://cointiply.com/r/Zn3J)</b> is a Bitcoin and Dogecoin faucet with multiple ways to earn, including; 
- Free bitcoin claims every hour 
- Playing games
- Watching videos
- Offerwalls
- PTC
- Completing special offers

There are 17 offerwalls in total, giving Cointiply plenty of earning potential. The chat section in there is very helpful if you have any questions. The chat also includes a rain function where you'll be rewarded with coins for your participation.

Coins you earn can be withdrawn as Bitcoin (BTC) or Dogecoin (DOGE). Withdrawals made are sent to your personal Bitcoin/Dogecoin wallet. 

Highly recommended, top paying site for me so far. I've withdrawn around US$500 so far without any problems.

<b>[Yannik.biz](http://yannik.biz/?ref=59594)</b> is a crypto faucet that has been running since 2015. You can currently claim Bitcoin and IOTA from the site. IOTA can only be claimed every hour, while Bitcoin can be claimed as often as you like starting from 10 minutes. 

The site also has a loyalty system where for every consecutive day you make a claim, your bonus will go up by 1% up to 100%. This means you will be able to double the amount BTC you earn in one claim.

Besides the faucet, [Yannik.biz](http://yannik.biz/?ref=59594) also lets you earn through its offerwalls, games and bounty programs.

<b>[Allcoins](https://allcoins.pw/?ref=15312)</b> really lives up to its name, as it is a faucet that lists 12 different cryptocurrencies. Currently you can claim the following crypto:

<br>

<b>[FaucetPay](https://faucetpay.io/?r=312183)</b> is a microwallet for cryptocurrencies that allows you to instantly receive payments from hundreds of faucets. I recommend using it as the withdrawal thresholds are low and the withdrawal fees are very reasonable. 

Most of the sites listed below will be able to send your earnings <b>directly to your crypto wallet</b> as well as to FaucetPay.

<br>

<b>[ES-Faucets](https://es.btcnewz.com/auth/register?ref=c5d8861315d5c1b59b57)</b> is a multicrypto faucet with plenty of earning opportunities. Unlike [Allcoins](https://allcoins.pw/?ref=15312) where you can claim one cryptocurrency every 5 minutes, ES-Faucets allows you to claim 13+ cryptocurrencies at the same time! 

You can claim from each of the 12+ faucets every 30 minutes. The amount you can claim increases as time goes on, but the rate it increases will slow down as well. The site also has its own ES-Coin that can be exchanged for any cryptocurrency on the site. Holding ES-Coin can also boost your faucet claims up to 150%. 

Besides holding ES-Coin, other bonuses such as daily loyalty and XP levels can boost all your claims up over 500%! When you first start out on the faucet, my advice would be to convert your crypto to ES-Coin to get the bonus percentage in your claims. From there, you'll be able to get higher amounts at the faucets.

Use the code below when you register to get a bonus 2500 ES-Coins into your account.

All of their faucets are also available on iOS and Android allowing you to claim easily on the mobile. You can withdraw your coins to [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), Direct-to-Wallet, or [FaucetPay](https://faucetpay.io/?r=312183)

Here's a list of coins you can claim at ES-Faucets

[Faucet Crypto](https://www.faucetcrypto.com/ref/286789) is a faucet where you can claim coins every hour or so. Coins can be earned through the offerwalls, viewing PTC ads and shortlinks. You earn more bonuses to your claims the higher level you are.

<br>

[Adbtc](https://r.adbtc.top/1725349) has a faucet function, but its main appeal is how they pay you Bitcoin to view other websites. The more active you are the more sites you can view. Casual but high earning. I mainly use this site while I watch TV.

[Fire Faucet](https://firefaucet.win/ref/324415) is a faucet that allows you to claim automatically. To do so, you first need to accumulate Auto Claim Points (ACP). The more ACP you have, the longer you can keep the autoclaim running.

ACP can be earned through the faucet, daily tasks, PTC, completing offers, shortlinks, mining and more. You can choose from 8 different cryptos (listed below) to auto claim, or you can even claim them all at once.

<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td>Dash (DASH)</td>
    <td>Bitcoin (BTC)</td>
    <td>Ethereum (ETH)</td>    
    <td>Digibyte (DGB)</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Dogecoin (DOGE)</td> 
    <td>Litecoin (LTC)</td>     
    <td>Tron (TRX)</td>
    <td>ZCash (ZEC)</td> 
  </tr>

Payments are made directly to your wallet or to [FaucetPay](https://faucetpay.io/?r=312183).

<br>

[Moremoney](https://moremoney.io/?ref=278876) is a high-paying faucet with multiple ways to earn crypto. Its hourly faucet alone pays more than most that are out there right now. This is a Bitcoin only site and withdrawals are sent directly to wallet or to [FaucetPay](https://faucetpay.io/?r=312183).

[GraB.TC](https://grab.tc/?ref=37967) is very similar to [Moremoney](https://moremoney.io/?ref=278876). There are many ways to earn and they hold contests just as frequently. Payments are paid out fast and withdrawal thresholds to [FaucetPay](https://faucetpay.io/?r=312183) are low.
