### What are crypto faucets?

Crypto faucets are sites or apps that dispense bitcoin or other altcoins for free. Now, before you get too excited, you won't be able to make a living out of this. But, it is a good way to earn some extra cash on the side. It is also a good way to learn about cryptocurrencies as an emerging technology and how they work without investing a cent.

Below is a list I have compiled of the faucet sites I use and have paid out. I'll keep the list updated and add to it or remove sites that stop paying out.

- Browser mining
- Mining game for passive income

Coins you earn can be withdrawn as Bitcoin(BTC) or Dogecoin(DOGE). Withdrawals made can be sent to your personal bitcoin/dogecoin address or your [FaucetHub](http://faucethub.io/r/42665771) account. [FaucetHub](http://faucethub.io/r/42665771) is a microwallet for cryptocurrencies and allows you to instantly receive payments from hundreds of faucets. I recommend using it as thresholds for withdrawal are much lower with [FaucetHub](http://faucethub.io/r/42665771).
